Screen handler for the Posner Paradigm Project
==========================

This module takes care of **sending the images to the screens upon request**.

The user can select which image to send on which screen via **rpc commands**.

During the **Posner Paradigm experiment**, the selection is done **automatically** by the `posner-manager` module.

Here are the letters in Black Times New Roman Serif Font Typeface to be displayed:

<img src="app/conf/letterF.jpg" width="50">
<img src="app/conf/letterT.jpg" width="50">

ps: please note that the images displayed here are resized for space restrictions
