With this experiment we want to investigate the gaze validity effect on interactional and non-interactional scenarios with robot.

Trial sequence:

The trials starts with the robot on a rest position, with its eyes closed for 1 second.

In the interaction scenario the robot opens its eyes and fixate at the participants'eyes for 1.5 seconds while, in the non-interaction scenario 
the robot opens its eyes and does not fixate at the particpants'eyes for 1.5 seconds (interaction/non-interaction is randomized).

As a next step the robots'eyes shift to the left or right screen (randomized).

Following the gaze shift, a letter F or T appears on the left/right screen for 200ms and the partipant is asked to discriminate the letter. The letter's identity 
and location is randomized throughout the experiment.

As soon as the response is given, the robot moves back to his initial position (rest position, eyes closed) and the next trials starts.
